# Learn To Code: Intro to JQuery and the DOM

Learn how to code the Galvanize way in jQuery and explore the Document Object Model (DOM)

## What IS jQuery?

JQuery (also called jQuery in this tutorial) is a JavaScript library initially released in 2006 and stands as the most popular JavaScript library in use today. This very quick tutorial will help you set up jQuery onto your computer and learn some of its basic usages. 

## What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (commonly known as the DOM) is a cross-platform, language-independent convention that allows you to communicate and interact with elements in HTML, XHTML, and XML. Applying a tree-like structure, the DOM is essential to any training of jQuery.
